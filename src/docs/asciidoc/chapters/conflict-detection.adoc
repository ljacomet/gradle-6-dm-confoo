== Dependency conflict detection with capabilities

=== Capabilities as feature declarations

* Software components can provide multiple capabilities.
* A dependency graph can only have one module that provides a given capability
* Ideally, you would be able to express dependency on a capability instead of a concrete module
** "I need a logging implementation" instead of "I need `slf4j-simple` "

=== Addressing the logging ecosystem challenge
