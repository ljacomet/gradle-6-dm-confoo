# Next generation dependency management with Gradle

**Demo Project**: [demos/dm-gradle-6](demos/dm-gradle-6) 

Gradle 6.0 is the culmination of several years of innovative improvements in Dependency
Management. Embracing the idea that there is more to software composition and reuse than
just putting a set of jar files on the classpath, Gradle now offers a new metadata format
to richly define software components that are often made up of multiple files, different
variants and specific constraints on their dependencies.
